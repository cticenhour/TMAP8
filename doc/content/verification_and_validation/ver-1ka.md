# Simple Volumetric Source

## General Case Description

This problem involves two enclosures connected by a diffusive membrane that follows Sieverts law for diffusion. Both enclosures contain hydrogen (H$_2$), tritium (T$_2$), and tritium gas (HT). In the first enclosure, there is an initial inventory of only hydrogen (H$_2$) along with a constant volumetric source rate of tritium (T$_2$). The second enclosure starts out empty.

## Case Set Up

This verification problem is taken from [!cite](ambrosek2008verification). 
The rise in pressure of T$_2$ molecules in the first enclosure can be monitored by not enabling T$_2$ molecules to traverse the membrane between the two enclosures (no tritium flux). Consequently, the rate of pressure increase in the first enclosure can be expressed as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:source_term}
\frac{dP_{T_2}}{dt} = \frac{S}{V} kT,
\end{equation}

where $S$ represents the volumetric T$_2$ source rate, $V$ is the volume of the enclosure, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the enclosure.
In this case, $S$ is set to 10$^{20}$ molecules/m$^{-3}$/s, $V = 1$ m$^3$, and the temperature of the enclosure is constant at $T = 500$ K. 

## Analytical Solution

The analytical solution for [eq:source_term] is simply

\begin{equation}
P_{T_2}(t) = \frac{S}{V} kT t.
\end{equation}

## Results

Comparison of the TMAP8 results and the analytical solution is shown in
[ver-1ka_comparison_time] as a function of time. The TMAP8 code predictions match very well with the analytical solution with a root mean squared percentage error of RMSPE $= 0.00$ %.
