# Diffusion in a composite layer

## Test Description

This verification problem is taken from [!cite](longhurst1992verification, ambrosek2008verification). In this problem, a composite structure of PyC and SiC is modeled with a constant concentration boundary condition of the free surface of PyC and zero concentration boundary condition on the free surface of the SiC. The steady-state solution for the PyC is given as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:steady_state_pyc}
    C = C_0 \left[1 + \frac{x}{l}  \left(\frac{a D_{PyC}}{a D_{PyC} + l D_{SiC}} - 1 \right) \right]
\end{equation}

while the concentration profile for the SiC layer is given as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:steady_state_sic}
    C = C_0 \left(\frac{a+l-x}{l} \right) \left(\frac{a D_{PyC}}{a D_{PyC} + l D_{SiC}} \right)
\end{equation}

where

    $x$ = distance from free surface of PyC

    $a$ = thickness of the PyC layer (33 $\mu$m)

    $l$ = thickness of the SiC layer (63 $\mu$m in TMAP4 verification case, and 66 $\mu$m in TMAP7 verification case)

    $C_0$ = concentration at the PyC free surface (50.7079 moles/m$^3$)

    $D_{PyC}$ = diffusivity in PyC (1.274 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ m$^2$/s)

    $D_{SiC}$ = diffusivity in SiC (2.622 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ m$^2$/s)

The analytical transient solution for the concentration in the SiC side of the composite slab is given as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:transient}
    C = C_0 \left\{ \frac{D_{PyC}(l-x)}{l D_{PyC} + a D_{SiC}} - 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(a \lambda_n) \sin(k l \lambda_n) \sin \left[k (l-x) \lambda_n \right]}{\lambda_n \left[ a \sin^2(k l \lambda_n) + l \sin^2 (a \lambda_n) \right]} \exp(-D_{PyC} \lambda_n^2 t) \right\}
\end{equation}

where

$k$ = $\sqrt{\frac{D_{PyC}}{D_{SiC}}}$

and $\lambda_n$ are the roots of

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:roots}
    \frac{1}{\tan(\lambda a)} + \frac{1}{k \; \tan(k l \lambda)} = 0.
\end{equation}

!alert warning title=Typo in [!cite](longhurst1992verification,ambrosek2008verification)
[eqn:roots] for the roots of $\lambda$ is different from the equations provided in [!cite](longhurst1992verification,ambrosek2008verification), as they both have typographical errors and give different analytical solutions from the one provided in the figures of these reports.

## Results

[ver-1e_comparison_dist] shows the comparison of the TMAP8 calculation and the analytical solution for concentration after steady-state is reached. The plots show the TMAP8 and analytical solution comparisons for both the TMAP4 case ($l = 63$ $\mu$m) and the TMAP7 case ($l = 66$ $\mu$m).

For transient solution comparison, the concentration at a point, which is $x$ $\mu$m away from the PyC-SiC interface into the SiC layer, is obtained using the TMAP code and analytically. [ver-1e_comparison_time] shows comparison of the TMAP calculation with the analytical solution for this transient case. In the TMAP4 case, $x$ = 8 $\mu$m, and in the TMAP7 case $x$ = 15.75 $\mu$m. There is good agreement between TMAP and the analytical solution for both steady state and transient cases. In both cases, the root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) is under 0.2%.

The error is calculated between the TMAP8 and analytical solution values after $t$ = 0.2 s. This is in order to ignore the unphysical predictions of the analytical solution at very small times as shown in [ver-1e_comparison_time_zoomed], which is a close-up view of [ver-1e_comparison_time] close to the start of the simulation.

## Input files

!style halign=left
It is important to note that the input file used to reproduce these results and the input file used as test in TMAP8 are different. Indeed, the input file [/ver-1e.i] has a fine mesh and uses small time steps to accurately match the analytical solutions and reproduce the figures above. To limit the computational costs of the tests, however, the tests run a version of the file with a coarser mesh and larger time steps. More information about the changes can be found in the test specification file for this case [/ver-1e/tests].
