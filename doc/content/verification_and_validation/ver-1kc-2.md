# ver-1kc-2

# Sievertsâ€™ Law Boundaries with No Volumetric Source

## General Case Description

Two enclosures are separated by a membrane that allows diffusion according to Sieverts' law, with no volumetric source present. Enclosure 2 has twice the volume of Enclosure 1.

## Case Set Up

This verification problem is taken from [!cite](ambrosek2008verification).

Unlike the ver-1kc-1 case, which only considers tritium T$_2$, this setup describes a diffusion system in which tritium T$_2$, dihydrogen H$_2$ and tritium hybride HT are modeled across a one-dimensional domain split into two enclosures. The total system length is $2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ m, divided into 100 segments. The system operates at a constant temperature of 500 Kelvin. Initial tritium T$_2$ and dihydrogen H$_2$ pressures are specified as $10^{5}$ Pa for Enclosure 1 and $10^{-10}$ Pa for Enclosure 2. Initially, there is no tritium hybride HT in either enclosures.

The reaction between the species is described as follows

\begin{equation}
\text{H}_2 + \text{T}_2 \leftrightarrow 2\text{HT}
\end{equation}

The diffusion process for each species in the two enclosures can be expressed by

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C_1}{\partial t} = \nabla D \nabla C_1,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C_2}{\partial t} = \nabla D \nabla C_2,
\end{equation}

where $C_1$ and $C_2$ represent the concentration fields in enclosures 1 and 2 respectively, $t$ is the time, and $D$ denotes the diffusivity.

This case is similar to the [ver-1kb](ver-1kb.md) case, with the key difference being that sorption here follows Sieverts' law instead of Henry's law.
The concentration in Enclosure 1 is related to the partial pressure and concentration in Enclosure 2 via the interface sorption law:

\begin{equation}
C_1 = K P_2^n = K \left( C_2 RT \right)^n
\end{equation}

where $R$ is the ideal gas constant in J/mol/K, $T$ is the temperature in K, $K$ is the solubility, and $n$ is the exponent of the sorption law. For Sieverts' law, $n=0.5$.

## Results

We assume that $K = \frac{10}{\sqrt{RT}}$, which is expected to result in $C_1 = 10 \sqrt{C_2}$ at equilibrium.
As illustrated in [ver-1kc-2_comparison_time_k10], similarly to ver-1kc-1, T$_2$ and H$_2$ pressures reach equilibrium in both enclosures. What is new, however, is that HT is produced in both enclosures following the sorption law. The concentration ratios for T$_2$, H$_2$, and HT between enclosures 1 and 2, shown in [ver-1kc-2_concentration_ratio_T2_k10], [ver-1kc-2_concentration_ratio_H2_k10], and [ver-1kc-2_concentration_ratio_HT_k10], demonstrate that the results obtained with TMAP8 are consistent with the analytical results derived from the sorption law for $K \sqrt{RT} = 10$.

As shown in [ver-1kc-2_mass_conservation_k10], mass is conserved between the two enclosures over time for all species. The variation in mass is only $0.4$ % for T$_2$ and H$_2$. This variation in mass can be further minimized by refining the mesh, i.e., increasing the number of segments in the domain.

The input file for this case can be found at [/ver-1kc-2.i]. To limit the computational costs of the test cases, the tests run a version of the file with a coarser mesh and less number of time steps. More information about the changes can be found in the test specification file for this case [/ver-1kc-2/tests].
