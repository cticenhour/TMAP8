# Species Equilibration Problem in Lawdep Condition with Equal Starting Pressures

## General Case Description

This verification problem is taken from [!cite](ambrosek2008verification) and builds on [ver-1ia](ver-1ia.md). The configuration and modeling parameters are similar to [ver-1ia](ver-1ia.md), except that, in the current case, the reaction is in lawdep condition. The case is simulated in [/ver-1ie.i].

The problem considers the reaction between two isotopic species, A$_2$ and B$_2$, on a surface in lawdep condition. The reaction between AB, A$_2$, and B$_2$ is the same as in [ver-1ia](ver-1ia.md). Therefore, the partial pressure of AB in equilibrium depends on the initial partial pressures of A$_2$ and B$_2$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p_AB_equilibrium}
P_{AB}^{eq} = \frac{2 P_{A_2}^0 P_{B_2}^0}{P_{A_2}^0 + P_{B_2}^0}.
\end{equation}

Just as in [ver-1ia](ver-1ia.md), we solve the net current of AB molecules from surface to the enclosure with

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equation_p_ab}
\frac{d P_{AB}}{dt} = \frac{S k_b T}{V} (2 K_r C_A C_B - K_d P_{AB}),
\end{equation}

where $t$ is the time, $S$ is the surface area, $k_b$ is the Boltzmann’s constant, $T$ is the temperature, $V$ is the volume in the enclosure, $K_r$ and $K_d$ are the recombination and dissociation coefficients, and $C_A$ and $C_B$ are the concentration of atoms from A$_2$ and B$_2$ on the reactive surface, respectively. In lawdep diffusion boundary condition, the concentration of A$_2$ and B$_2$ are always fixed relative to the partial pressures in the gas over the surface. When heteronuclear species formation is involved, TMAP8 uses logic similar to that used in the ratedep and surfdep condition for the arrival rate of gas atoms to the surface. However, there are no barriers to adsorption or release, and conversion is assumed to take place instantaneously. Any gas that does not diffuse away is immediately released from the surface. Therefore, the concentration of A$_2$ and B$_2$ from Sieverts' law are given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p_ca_relation}
C_A = K_s \sqrt{P_{A_2}},
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p_cb_relation}
C_B = K_s \sqrt{P_{B_2}},
\end{equation}

where $K_s$ is Sieverts’ solubility. Due to in the isotopic reaction, $K_s$ is the same for each homonuclear species. The relationship between $K_s$, $K_r$, and $K_d$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_relation}
K_d = {K_s}^2 K_r.
\end{equation}

This case uses equal starting pressures of $1 \times 10^{4}$ Pa of A$_2$ and B$_2$ and no AB. $K_d$ is specified to be $1.858 \times 10^{24}/\sqrt{T}$ atom/m$^2$/s/pa. $K_s$ is specified to be $1 \times 10^{24}$ atom/m$^3$/Pa$^{0.5}$, the temperature is 1000 K, the surface area for reaction is 0.05 m $\times$ 0.05 m square, and the enclosure volume is 1 m$^3$.


## Analytical solution

After combining [eq:p_ca_relation] and [eq:p_cb_relation], [eq:equation_p_ab] becomes

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equation_p_ab_final}
\frac{d P_{AB}}{dt} = \frac{S k_b T K_d}{V} \left(2 \sqrt{P^0_{A_2} - \frac{P_{AB}}{2}} \sqrt{P^0_{B_2} - \frac{P_{AB}}{2}} - P_{AB} \right).
\end{equation}

This is a non-linear function, but it has a special solution when $P^0_{A_2} = P^0_{B_2}$, which is true in the current case. Thus, the analytical solution for the partial pressure of AB is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:analytical_solution}
P_{AB}  = P_{A_2}^0 \left(1 - \exp \left( -\frac{ 2 S K_d k_b T}{V} t \right)\right).
\end{equation}

## Results

A comparison of the concentration of AB as a function of time is plotted in [ver-1ie_comparison_pressure]. The TMAP8 calculations are found to be in good agreement with the analytical solution, with a root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) of RMSPE =  0.36%. The concentrations of A$_2$ and B$_2$ as a function of time are also plotted in [ver-1ie_comparison_pressure].
