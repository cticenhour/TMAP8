# val-2a

# Ion Implantation Experiment

## Case Description

This validation problem is taken from [!cite](anderl1985tritium). This paper describes an ion implantation experiment on a modified 316 stainless steel called Primary Candidate Alloy (PCA). This case is part of the validation suite of TMAP4 and TMAP7 as val-2a [!citep](longhurst1992verification,ambrosek2008verification). The PCA sample is a 0.5 mm thick disk with a diameter of 2.5 cm. It is exposed to a deuterium ion beam on the left side (also called the upstream side of the sample). The TRIM code [!citep](biersack1982stopping) was used in [!cite](longhurst1992verification,ambrosek2008verification) to determine that the average implantation depth for the ions is 11 nm $\pm$ 5.4 nm. Reemission data from the TRIM calculation shows that only 75 % of the incident flux remained in the metal and other 25 % is re-emitted.

This model considers the diffusion in PCA and the recombination of deuterium on both sides. First, the diffusion of deuterium in PCA is described as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:diffusion}
\frac{d C}{d t} = \nabla D \nabla C + S,
\end{equation}

where $C$ is the concentration of deuterium in PCA, $t$ is the time, $D$ is the diffusivity of deuterium in PCA, and $S$ is the source term in PCA due to the deuterium ion implantation.

Second, the deuterium recombines into gas on both sides of the PCA sample. By assuming that the recombination process is at steady state (which is not a necessary assumption in TMAP8, but appropriate in this case), it is described as the following surface flux:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:recombination}
J = 2 A (K_r C^2 - K_d P),
\end{equation}

where $J$ is the recombination flux out of the sample sides, $A$ is the area on the upstream or downstream side, $P$ is the pressure on the corresponding side, and $K_r$ and $K_d$ are the recombination and dissociation coefficients, respectively. The coefficient of 2 accounts for the fact that 2 deuterium atoms form one D$_2$ molecule.

The objective of this simulation is to determine the permeation flux on the downstream side and match the experimental data published in [!cite](anderl1985tritium) and reproduced in [val-2a_comparison].

## Model Description

In this case, TMAP8 simulates a one-dimensional domain to represent the deuterium implantation, diffusion, and recombination. Note that this case can easily be extended to a two- or three-dimensional case.

The source term in the model is described as a normal distribution instead of the piecewise function from TMAP4 [!citep](longhurst1992verification). The source term of deuterium from ion beam implantation is defined as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:normal_distribution}
S = F \frac{1.5}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left( - \frac{(x - \mu )^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right),
\end{equation}

where $F$ is the implantation flux provided in [val-2a_flux_and_pressure_TMAP4], $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-9}$ m is the characteristic width of the normal distribution, and $\mu = 14 \times 10^{-9}$ m is the depth of the normal distribution from the upstream side. [eq:normal_distribution] uses the same factor of 1.5 from [!cite](longhurst1992verification) to better correspond to implantation of experiment from [!cite](anderl1985tritium). The comparison between the normal distribution from TMAP8 and piecewise function from TMAP4 is shown in [val-2a_normal_distribution]. The normal distribution has a similar distribution to the piecewise function, but the distribution profile is closer to the expected implantation profile.

       caption= Comparison between the normal distribution from TMAP8 and piecewise function from TMAP4 for the source term due to deuterium ion beam implantation.

The pressures on the upstream and downstream sides are close to vacuum pressures, and have only little impact for the recombination on both sides [!citep](longhurst1992verification,ambrosek2008verification). Thus, TMAP8 ignores the impact of pressure on the boundary conditions to simplify the model. The recombination is described as a simplified version of [eq:recombination]:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:recombination_ignore_Pressure}
J = 2 A K_r C^2.
\end{equation}

## Case and Model Parameters

The beam flux on the upstream side of the sample during the experiment is presented in [val-2a_flux_and_pressure_TMAP4], and only 75 % of the flux remain in the sample. Other case and model parameters used in TMAP8 are listed in [val-2a_set_up_values_TMAP4].

!alert warning title=Typo in [!cite](longhurst1992verification)
The times listed in [!cite](longhurst1992verification) for TMAP8 for the start and end times of the beam are not accurate. instead, TMAP8 uses the times directly from [!cite](anderl1985tritium) to better correspond to experimental conditions.

!alert note title=This validation case replicates TMAP4 rather than TMAP7 due to inconsistent experiment results with [!cite](anderl1985tritium).
TMAP4 [!citep](longhurst1992verification) and TMAP7 [!citep](ambrosek2008verification) both replicate this validation case. However, they use different model parameters and configurations, and the experimental data presented in [!citep](ambrosek2008verification) for TMAP7 do not correspond to the data published in [!cite](anderl1985tritium). We therefore replicate only the data from TMAP4 and [!cite](anderl1985tritium) in this TMAP8 validation case.

!alert note title=The upstream recombination and dissociation coefficients as time-dependent exponentials.
Both TMAP4 [!citep](longhurst1992verification) and TMAP7 [!citep](ambrosek2008verification) describe the upstream recombination and dissociation coefficients as time-dependent exponentials rather than mechanistically capture the influence of ion irradiation on material performance. TMAP8 uses the same expressions.

## Results

[val-2a_comparison] shows the comparison of the TMAP8 calculation and the experimental data from [!cite](anderl1985tritium). There is reasonable agreement between the TMAP predictions and the experimental data with a root mean square percentage error of RMSPE = 25.95 %. Note that the agreement could be improved by adjusting the model parameters. It is also possible to perform this optimization with [MOOSE's stochastic tools module](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/stochastic_tools/index.html).
