# Diffusion Problem with Constant Source Boundary Condition

This verification problem is taken from [!cite](longhurst1992verification). Diffusion of tritium through a semi-infinite SiC layer is modeled with a constant
source located on one boundary. No solubility or trapping is included. The
concentration as a function of time and position is given by
\begin{equation}
C = C_0 \; erfc \left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $C_0$ the constant source concentration, erfc is the error function, $x$ is the distance from the boundary, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $t$ is the time.

Comparison of the TMAP8 results and the analytical solution is shown in
[ver-1b_comparison_time] as a function of time at
$x = 0.2$ mm. For simplicity, both the diffusion coefficient and the initial
concentration were set to unity. The TMAP8 code predictions match
the analytical solution very well.

As a second check, the concentration as a function of position at a given time
$t = 25$ s calculated by TMAP8 was compared with the analytical solution as shown in
[ver-1b_comparison_dist]. The predicted concentration profile from TMAP8 is in
good agreement with the analytical solution.

Finally, the diffusive flux ($J$) was compared with the analytic solution where the
flux is proportional to the derivative of the concentration with respect to $x$ and
is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:flux}
J = C_0 \; \sqrt{\frac{D}{t\pi}} \; exp \left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right).
\end{equation}

The flux as given by [eq:flux] is compared with values calculated by TMAP8.
The diffusivity, D, and the initial concentration, $C_0$, were both
taken as unity, and the distance, $x$, was taken as 0.5 in this comparison.
TMAP8 initially underpredicts but the results match well subsequently. Comparison
results are shown in [ver-1b_comparison_flux] with a root mean square percentage
error of RMSPE = 6.03 %. The error is calculated for $t \geq 10$ s due to infinite
value at small $t$.

The oscillations in the permeation graph go away with increasing fineness in the
mesh and in the time step `dt`.

## Input files

!style halign=left
The input file for this case can be found at [/ver-1b.i], which is different from the input file used as test in TMAP8. To limit the computational costs of the test cases, the tests run a version of the file with a coarser mesh and larger time steps. More information about the changes can be found in the test specification file for this case [/ver-1b/tests].
