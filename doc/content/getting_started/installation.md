# Installation

## Step One: Install Conda MOOSE Environment

!style halign=left
In order to install TMAP8, the MOOSE developer environment must be installed. The
installation procedure depends on your operating system, so click on the MOOSE
website link below that corresponds to your operating system/platform and follow
the instructions until you are done with the step named "Install MOOSE" (note that
you do not need to follow the steps from the section titled "Cloning MOOSE" and below). Then,
return to this page and continue with Step Two.

- [Linux and MacOS](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/conda.html)
- [Windows 10 (experimental)](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/windows10.html)

Advanced manual installation instructions for this environment are available
[via the MOOSE website](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/index.html).

If an error or other issue is experienced while using the conda environment,
please see [the MOOSE troubleshooting guide for Conda](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/help/troubleshooting.html#condaissues)

!alert! note title=Interested in TMAP8 on HPC?
Those users & developers interested in running TMAP8 on an HPC cluster environment can find more
information about that user case in our [getting_started/hpc.md] instructions.
!alert-end!

!alert! note title=Interested in TMAP8 in a Docker Container?
Note that a Docker container image of TMAP8 is available. This is intended mostly for users who desire a pre-compiled copy of TMAP8 for testing or use in production simulations and do not mind the overhead of virtualization. To view these instructons, please proceed to the [getting_started/docker.md exact=True] page.
!alert-end!

## Step Two: Clone TMAP8

!style halign=left
TMAP8 is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/idaholab/TMAP8), and should be
cloned directly from there using [git](https://git-scm.com/). As in the MOOSE
directions, it is recommended that users create a directory named "projects" to
put all of your MOOSE-related work.

To clone TMAP8, run the following commands in Terminal:

```bash
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/idaholab/TMAP8.git
cd TMAP8
git checkout main
```

!alert! note title=TMAP8 branches
This sequence of commands downloads TMAP8 from the GitHub server and checks
out the "main" code branch. There are two code branches available:

- "main", which is the current most-tested version of TMAP8 for general usage, and
- "devel", which is intended for code development (and may be more regularly broken
  as changes occur in TMAP8 and MOOSE).

Developers wishing to add new features should create a new branch for submission
off of the current "devel" branch.
!alert-end!

## Step Three: Build and Test TMAP8

!style halign=left
To compile TMAP8, first make sure that the conda MOOSE environment is activated
(*and be sure to do this any time that a new Terminal window is opened*):

```bash
conda activate moose
```

Then navigate to the TMAP8 clone directory and download the MOOSE submodule:

```bash
cd ~/projects/TMAP8
git submodule update --init moose
```

!alert! tip title=Thermochimica library (optional)
To have access to the optional thermochemistry library Thermochimica [!cite](piro2013) provided within
the MOOSE [modules/chemical_reactions/index.md], check out the corresponding submodule by performing
the following before building:

```bash
cd ~/projects/TMAP8/moose
git submodule update --init --checkout modules/chemical_reactions/contrib/thermochimica
```
!alert-end!

!alert note
The copy of MOOSE provided with TMAP8 has been fully tested against the current
TMAP8 version, and is guaranteed to work with all current TMAP8 tests.

Once all dependencies have been downloaded, TMAP8 can be compiled and tested:

```bash
make -j8
./run_tests -j8
```

!alert! note
The `-j8` flag in the above commands signifies the number of processor cores used to
build the code and run the tests. The number in that flag can be changed to the
number of physical and virtual cores on the workstation being used to build TMAP8.
!alert-end!

If TMAP8 is working correctly, all active tests will pass. This indicates that
TMAP8 is ready to be used and further developed.

## Update TMAP8

TMAP8 (and the underlying MOOSE Framework) is under heavy development and is updated on a continuous
basis. Therefore, it is important that the local copy of TMAP8 be periodically updated to obtain new
capabilities, improvements, and bugfixes. Weekly updates are recommended as, at minimum, the MOOSE
submodule within TMAP8 is updated up to several times a week.

!alert! note title=Always update TMAP8 and the Conda packages together.
There is a tight dependency between the libraries and applications provided by Conda, and the
submodules that TMAP8 depends on. Therefore, when you update one, you should always update the other.
!alert-end!

To update your conda environment to the newest `moose-dev` development package release, perform the
following commands (assuming that your MOOSE-based development environment is named `moose`):

```bash
conda activate moose
conda update moose-dev
```

To update your TMAP8 repository as a TMAP8 user, use the following commands, which provide to general
users the content of the most stable branch (`upstream/main`):

```bash
cd ~/projects/TMAP8
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git submodule update moose
```

To update your TMAP8 repository as a TMAP8 developer who regularly makes modifications to the code,
use the following commands, which provide developers with the `devel` branch:

```bash
cd ~/projects/TMAP8
git checkout devel
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/devel
git submodule update moose
```

Both sets of instructions assume that your copy of TMAP8 is stored in `~/projects` and that the
[idaholab/TMAP8](https://github.com/idaholab/TMAP8) git remote is labeled `upstream`. Use `git remote -v`
in the TMAP8 repository location to check for this and change the commands as necessary. Finally,
TMAP8 can be re-compiled and re-tested.

```bash
make -j8
./run_tests -j8
```
