# TMAP8
Tritium Migration Analysis Program (TMAP8)

TMAP8 is an open-source, MOOSE-based application developed to provide state-of-the-art tritium transport and fuel cycle modeling capabilities.
TMAP8 aims to expand the capabilities of previous versions (i.e., TMAP4 and TMAP7) by leveraging modern computational techniques; ensuring high software quality assurance standards (key to building trust); and enabling multispecies, multiscale, and multiphysics simulations for integrated tritium transport modeling in complex geometries.

The [TMAP8 documentation](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/tmap8) includes the code reference, a getting started guide, and details about software quality assurance (SQA) processes, verification, validation, and examples case, etc.

When using TMAP8, please cite the following.
