#
# Info:
# - This input file used to generate polycrystals for SiC.
# - This simulation predicts phase evolution based on a grain growth phase field model.
# - The pore and the ceramics represent two different phases and the initial conditions
#   are provided with a black and white picture, which is read by ImageFunction.
# - The simulation smoothens the interface between the two phases.
#
#
# Once TMAP8 is installed and built (see instructions on the TMAP8 website), run with
# cd ~/projects/TMAP8/test/tests/pore_scale_transport/
# mpirun -np 8 ~/projects/TMAP8/tmap8-opt -i 2D_microstructure_reader_smoothing_base.i pore_structure_open.params
